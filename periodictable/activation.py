Calculate expected neutron activation from time spent in beam line.

Accounts for burnup and 2n, g production.

This is only a gross estimate.  Many effects are not taken into account, such as
self-shielding in the sample and secondary activation from the decay products.

**Introduction to neutron activation terminology**

See a text!! These are just a few notes to refresh the memory of those who
already know the topic.

Reactions: The most common reaction is the simple addition of a neutron,
thereby increasing its atomic number by one but leaving it as the same
element. Not all activation products are radioactive. Those that are not are
not included in this database. Beware that there are production chains that
depend upon these intermediate products. This database does not address those
more complicated processes.

There are exceptions to the simple addition process such as the n,alpha
reaction of Li-6. These then result in a different element as the activation
product. These are identified in the reaction column. Radioactive products
also have the potential of undergoing a neutron reaction. This is
accounted for in this database for selected products (generally those that
result in significant half-life products). These reactions and products
should only be important at very high fluences, i.e., >1E16 n/cm2.

Neutron energy: The majority of the reactions are initiated by thermal neutrons.
As a practical matter the number of thermal neutrons is usually measured with a
cadmium filter. This excludes the neutrons above the cadmium absorption
threshold, called the cadmium cutoff. For most materials the resulting measured
'thermal' neutron fluence is adequate to determine the thermal neutron
activation. A few materials have large cross-sections for the neutrons above the
cadmium cutoff. Hence a 'cadmium ratio' is needed to predict the number of
neutrons present above this cutoff, as seen by the specific reaction of
interest.

For the same neutron spectrum two different elements will have different
cadmium ratios. Similarly, for the same reaction but different neutron
environments the ratio will also vary.  Copper is a good material on which
to predict the thermal-to-epithermal fluence ratio since its two cross-sections
are about equal.  If you use the ratio of another reaction, correct the
activity ratio of the nuclide by the cross-section ratio in order to derive
the extimated fluence ratio.  Take care.  By definition, the cadmium ratio
is an activity ratio, not a fluence ratio.  [Note: This ratio is divided
into the specfied thermal neutron fluence rate to get the epithermal rate.]

Fast neutron reactions: There are also those reactions that depend on
higher energy neutrons. These can be of a great variety: n,gamma; n,p;
n,d; n,alpha; n,triton; etc. Any they are highly variable in how high the
neutron energy must be to initiate the reaction. In general the cross-
sections are relatively small, e.g., 10's of millibarns and less as compared
to 1000's of barns in some cases for thermal reactions. Plus the fast
neutron fluences are much smaller so that in general the amount of the
activation product is much less than for thermal production processes.

Barn: As they say- just how big is the broad side of that barn? For neutrons
it is 1 E-24 cm2, e.g. 0.000000000000000000000001 square cm. Millibarns
are of course for the _______ (leprechauns?).

Calulation:
(number of atoms)*(cross-section)*(no. of neutrons)*(decay correction)*C.F.

Number of atoms: mass*avagadro's number*isotopic abundance/mole.weight
  where the mass is that of the target element, not the whole sample.

Decay correction: Since the radioactive product decays while it is being
  made one must correct for this using (1-exp(-0.693*t/hlflf))
  where t is the exposure time and hlflf is the product halflife

C.F: includes unit conversion factors, e.g., convert to microcuries


Example::

    >>> from periodictable import activation
    >>> env = activation.ActivationEnvironment(fluence=1e5, Cd_ratio=70, fast_ratio=50, location="BT-2")
    >>> sample = activation.Sample("Co30Fe70", 10)
    >>> sample.calculate_activation(env, exposure=10, rest_times=[0, 1, 24, 360])

activation and after 1 hour, 1 day, and 15 days.

The neutron activation table, *activation.dat*,\ [#Shleien1998]_ contains
details about the individual isotopes, with interaction cross sections taken
from from IAEA-273\ [#IAEA1987]_.

Activation can be run from the command line using::

    $ python -m periodictable.activation FORMULA

# Comments on ACT_2N_X.xls from ACT_CALC.TXT
#
# Fast neutron cross-sections added 2/1/94
#
# One database error detected and corrected at this time.
#
# Corrections made 3/4/94
#
# 1. Halflife for entry 21 entered.       (previous entry blank)
# 2. Cross-section for entry 311 entered  (previous entry blank)
# 3. 2 beta mode entries - added parent lambda's
# 4. Changed range of look up function in 2 columns to include last row.
# 5. With 9E15 y halflife the calculation always returned 0 microcuries!
#     The 9E15 exceeds a math precision resulting in zero being assigned to the
#     the function 1-e(-x).  For any value of x<1E-10 the approximation x+x^2/2
#     is more accurate, and for values of X<1E-16 this approximation returns a
#     non-zero value while 1-e(-x)=0.
#     Appropriate changes have been made, but in fact only two entries are
#     affected by this, one with a 12 Ty halflife and one with a 9000Ty t1/2.
#     The equations for "b" mode production were not changed because they are
#     more complex, and none of the halflives currently in the database related
#     to this mode are a problem. Take care if you add more with very long halflives.
#     [PAK: These have since been updated to use expm1()]
# 6. The cross-section for the reaction Sr-88(n,gamma)Sr-89 was reduced from
#    .058 to .0058 b.  The entry of .058 in IAEA273 is in error, based on a
#    number of other references (including IAEA156).
# 7. The unit for the halflife of Pm-151 coorected from 'm' to 'h'
#
# Changes made in April 1994
#
# 1. Burnup cross-sections added to the database and nuclides produced by
#     two neutron additions (2n,gamma) have been added.  The activation equations
#     have been changed to account for burnup.  This does not become significant
#     until exposures exceed 1e17 n/cm2 (e.g., 1e10 n/cm2/sec*1000 hrs), even for
#     those with very large cross-sections.  Note that 'burnup' can be viewed as
#     loss of the intended n,gamma product or as a 2n,gamma production mode.  Both
#     effects are included in the database and equations.
# 2.ACT_CALC.WQ1 does not have the burnup equations or related cross-section data.
#     ACT_2N.WQ1 has the added equations and data, but requires manual entry of the
#     cross-section database index numbers.
#     ACT_2N_X.WQ1 allows direct entry of the chemical element to retrieve ALL
#     entries from the database for that element
#     Results from both have been compared to assure that the new spreadsheet
#     is correct.  Also the Au-197(2n,g)Au-199 reaction has been checked against
#     a textbook example (Friedlander,Kennedy,Miller:Nuclear Chemistry).
# 3.An educational note related to this addition:
# Computing the equation [exp(-x)-exp(-y)] in that syntax is better than using
# [exp(-x)*(1-exp(x-y))].  The latter format blows up when large
# values of X and Y are encountered due to computational limitations for these
# functions in a PC.  But this problem was only encountered in excess of
# 1E22 n/cm2.
# 4. 61 (2n,g) reactions have been added.  You will note many more
# radionuclides with secondary capture cross-sections.  Many of these go to
# stable nuclides (particularly the larger x-section ones - logically enough).
# The isomer-ground state pairs that have 2n modes to the same resulting
# nuclide are treated one of several ways.
#     - if the obvious dominate pathway is only through the ground state then
#     only production via that mode is included.
#     - if the combination of parent halflives and production cross-sections
#     make it unclear as to which is the dominant production mode then both
#     are calculated.  Beware, these are not necessarily additive values.
#     Sometimes the ground state also reflects production via the isomer.
#     See the specific notes for any particular reaction.
# 5.None of the entries for production via 'b' (beta decay ingrowth from a
# neutron induced parent) account for burnup.  Those with significant burnup
# cross-sections have a specific note reminding of this.  This is an issue
# only at high fluence rates.
# 6.Note that the database entries have different meanings for 'b' and '2n'
# production modes.  For instance, the first set of cross-sections (proceeding
# horizontally for a particular database entry) is not the cross-section of
# the 2n reaction, but that to produce the parent.  The second set of cross-
# sections which are the burnup cross-sections for n,g; n,p; n,alpha; etc.
# reactions are the production cross-sections for the 2n reactions.
# 7.If you want to determine how much burnup is occurring do one of the
# following:
#     - do the calculation separately in ACT_CALC and ACT_2N.
#     - do the calculation at a low fluence, e.g., 1E7, prorate to the fluence
#     of interest, and compare to the result calculated directly.  Make
#     certain the same exposure time is used.  You cannot prorate this
#     parameter.
#
# Additions/changes made July 1997
#
# The following n,p and n,alpha reactions have both a thermal cross-section (as
# per IAEA273) and a fast cross-section.  In all cases the database entry was for
# the fast cross-section but indicated it was a thermal reaction.  That has been
# corrected (and verified against IAEA156) and a second entry made for the thermal
# reaction.  Despite the entry in IAEA 273 there is some question as to whether
# the thermal induced reaction is energetically possible.  Dick Lindstrom's
# calculation shows that the coulomb barrier should prevent the thermal reaction
# from being possible.
#
# The entries changed, and added, are for the following:
#
#     35Cl (n,p)
#     35Cl (n,alpha)
#     33S (n,p)
#     39K (n,alpha)
#     40Ca (n,p)
#     58Ni (n,alpha)

        thermal neutron fluence.

        **Warning**: For very high fluences, e.g., >E16 to E17 n/cm2, the

        Neutron cadmium ratio.  Use 0 to suppress epithermal contribution.

        This is to account for those nuclides that have a significant

        tabulated in the cross-section database as the 'resonance cross-
        section'. Values can range from 4 to more than 100.

        ....... Use 0 for your initial calculation ..........

        If you do a specific measurement for the nuclide and spectrum

        This computation can be based on a Cd ratio of a material that has

        so that it reflects just the thermal to epithermal fluence ratio.
        The computation simply adds a portion of this resonance cross-section
        to the thermal cross-section based on the presumption that the
        Cd ratio reflects the fluence ratio. Copper is a good material on
        which to equate the Cd ratio to the thermal-epithermal fluence ratio.

        For other materials, correct for the thermal:epithermal cross-section
        ratio.

        At the NBSR this ranges from 12 in mid-core, to 200 at RT-4, to
        >2000 at a filtered cold neutron guide position.

    *fast_ratio* : float

        Thermal/fast ratio needed for fast reactions. Use 0 to suppress fast
        contribution.

        this is very reaction dependent. You in essence need to know the
        answer before you do the calculation! That is, this ratio depends
        upon the shape of the cross-section curve as well as the spectrum
        shape above the energy threshold of the reaction. But at least you
        can do 'what-if' calculations with worse case assumptions (in the
        absence of specific ratios).

        the fast cross-sections in this database are weighted for a fast
        maxwellian spectrum so the fast/thermal ratio should be just a
        fluence correction (i.e., a fluence ratio), not an energy correction.

        Fast neutron cross-sections from IAEA273 are manually spectrum weighted.
        Those from IAEA156 are fission spectrum averaged as tabulated.

        Use 50 (for NBSR calculations) as a starting point if you simply
        exploring for possible products.

def activity(isotope, mass, env, exposure, rest_times):
    """
    Compute isotope specific daughter products after the given exposure time and
    rest period.

    Activations are listed in *isotope.neutron_activation*. Most of the
    activations (n,g n,p n,a n,2n) define a single step process, where a neutron
    is absorbed yielding the daughter and some prompt radiation. The daughter
    itself will decay during exposure, yielding a balance between production and
    emission. Any exposure beyound about eight halflives will not increase
    activity for that product.

    Activity for daughter products may undergo further neutron capture, reducing
    the activity of the daughter product but introducing a grand daughter with
    its own activity.

    The data tables for activation are only precise to about three significant
    figures. Any changes to the calculations below this threshold, e.g., due to
    slightly different mass or abundance, are therefore of little concern.

    Database notes:

    Most of the cross-section data is from IAEA 273. This is an excellent
    compilation. I highly recommend its purchase. The fast neutron cross-section
    data entered in the spreadsheet is weighted by an U-235 maxwellian
    distributed fission spectrum. Allthermal reactions producing nuclides with a
    half-life in excess of 1 second, and some less than 1 second, are included.
    Also included are radioactive daughters with halflives substantially longer
    than the parent produced by the neutron induced reaction, i.e., those
    daughters not in secular equilibrium. See the database in for more detailed
    notes relating to the database entries.

    [Note: 150 fission spectrum averaged fast neutron reactions added from
    IAEA156 on 2/1/94.  All those that are tabulated as measured have been
    entered.  Those estimated by calculation have not been entered.  In practice
    this means that the convenient, observable products are in this database.
    Fast reactions included are n,p; n,alpha; n,2n; and n,n'.

    Reaction = b  : This is the beta produced daughter of an activated parent.
    This is calculated only for the cases where the daughter is long lived
    relative to the parent. In the reverse case the daughter activity is
    reasonably self evident and the parent nuclide is tagged to indicate a
    radioactive daughter. The calculated activity of the beta produced
    daughter is through the end of irradiation. Contributions from the
    added decay of the parent after the end of irradiation are left for the
    user to determine, but are usually negligible for irradiations that are
    long relative to the parent halflife:

        A1 = K [1-exp(-L1*t)]   where A1 is activity, L1 is decay constant

    For the beta produced daughter the activity (A2) is:

        A2 = K [1- exp(-L1*t) * L2/(L2-L1) + exp(-L2*t) * L1/(L2-L1)]

    where K is the parent saturation activity.
